# MDI Search

Search icons from MDI [materialdesignicons.com](materialdesignicons.com) powered by Algolia. 

## Why ?

Searching MDI icons is a pain. As a front-end developper I need to quickly find an icon and I do not need icon preview or download. I simply need to get the icon name and paste it in my IDE, nothing else. 

## How ?

[materialdesignicons.com](materialdesignicons.com) provides open sources icons and a collaborative list of meta tags. You can find this list [in one of their repo](https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign-SVG/blob/master/meta.json). I have pushed this list to Algolia, and build a simple Vue SPA around it (this repo).
